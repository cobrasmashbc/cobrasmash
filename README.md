## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repo and open it in your browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cobrasmashbc/cobrasmash.git
cd cobrasmash
```

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser, or use a local server (recommended for JS modules):

### Option 1: Open in browser (no module support)

* Drag and drop `index.html` into Chrome or Edge (not Firefox, due to module CORS issues)

### Option 2: Use a local dev server

Install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code or run:

```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whichever port is shown).

---

## 🗃️ Data-Driven Architecture

Data is dynamically loaded from the `/data/` folder:

* `news.json` — Articles and latest events.
* `players.json` — Club member profiles.
* `slider.json` — Hero slider image/content.
* `testimonials-latest.json` — Testimonials display.

Modular JS components like `contentLoader.js` and `heroSlider.js` fetch and display this data seamlessly.

---

## 🛠️ Development Tips

```bash
# Common Git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```

To update content, edit the relevant JSON files and assets — no back-end required.
